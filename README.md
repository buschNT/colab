# colab
You can find my basic colab setup in `setup_repository.ipynb`. It includes:
- configuration file (template: `colab_configuration_template.yaml`)
- public git repository (here: `https://github.com/buschNT/deep_learning_public.git`)
- private git repository

The configuration file has to be stored on your google drive, which will be mounted in colab. Please provide the required information to install the private repository.

This colab setup is based on two python modules, which you can use to implement high level functions/classes. Thus, only a few function calls may be necessary to train a neural net.
